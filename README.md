# Workshop FEAA ML

This workshop consists of 6 weeks of short presentation of Python principles, basic data analysis and introduction to machine learning, followed up by an assignment which lets the students play around in each topic.

## Week 1

Introduction in Python with:
 - numpy
 - pandas
 - matplotlib

Basic concepts of Data Analysis:
 - types of data
 - plotting data
 - dealling with missing values
 - correlation between features and targets

**Assignment**: Take the avocado dataset and play around with the data, following some tasks like: checking for missing data, grouping the data by different features, checking for categorical data and bringing them to one-hot-encoding format, etc.

## Week 2

Introduction in basic Machine Learning and the types of learners and the description of each type:
 - supervised learning
   - classification
   - regression
 - unsupervised learning
   - clustering
   - dimensionality reduction
 - reinforcement learning

Short description of Simple Linear Regression and Logistic regression.

Preseting Scikit-learn shortly.

Going through the `iris` dataset and predicting the target value using Logistic Regression.

**Assignment**: Titanic Dataset - predict if a passenger will survive or not on the Titanic.
